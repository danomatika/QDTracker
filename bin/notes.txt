HeadOSC

computes simple kinect head approximation & sends position over OSC

*kinect 1 / xbox 360 kinect only*

algorithm:

* find person
* find highest point in person contour. ignore positions outside of person centroid += highestPointThreshold
* compute approx head position by interpolating along line between person centroid & highest point 

pros: simple & fast
cons: not truely 3d, more like 2.5 since it's only from 1 perspective; no orientation data

settings: data/settings.xml -> see settings file comments for info

key commands:

* r: toggle rgb & depth image
* =/-: increase/decrease kinect depth threshold
* s: save settings
* l: load settings
* R (shift+r): reset settings to defaults
* x: toggle x pos normalization
* y: toggle y pos normalization
* z: toggle z pos normalization
